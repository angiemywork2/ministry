					Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
					<sup>2</sup> I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;<br>
					My God, in Him I will trust.”<br>
					<sup>3</sup> Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler[a]<br>
					And from the perilous pestilence.<br>
					<sup>4</sup> He shall cover you with His feathers,<br>
					And under His wings you shall take refuge;<br>
					His truth shall be your shield and buckler.<br>
					<sup>5</sup> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,<br>
					Nor of the arrow that flies by day,<br>
					<sup>6</sup> Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,<br>
					Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.<br>
					<sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side,<br>
					And ten thousand at your right hand;<br>
					But it shall not come near you.<br>
					<sup>8</sup> Only with your eyes shall you look,<br>
					And see the reward of the wicked.<br>
					<sup>9</sup> Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,<br>
					Even the Most High, your dwelling place,<br>
					<sup>10</sup> No evil shall befall you,<br>
					Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;<br>
					<sup>11</sup> For He shall give His angels charge over you,<br>
					To keep you in all your ways.<br>
					<sup>12</sup> In their hands they shall bear you up,<br>
					Lest you dash your foot against a stone.<br>
					<sup>13</sup> You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,<br>
					The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.<br>
					<sup>14</sup> “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;<br>
					I will set him on high, because he has known My name.<br>
					<sup>15</sup> He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;<br>
					I will be with him in trouble;<br>
					I will deliver him and honor him.<br>
					<sup>16</sup> With long life I will satisfy him,<br>
					And show him My salvation.”</font></p>
