	 		<div id="bio">
				<p>My name is Dale Washington, I've been positioned in the Body of Christ by GOD as a teacher with a prophetic anointing, and I prophesy through dreams and visions.  Daniel 5:12 anointing.
				I became born again in 1994.  Afterwards, I attended a local church in which I served for 18 years in various capacities.  I served as a Sunday school teacher/bible study, Evangelists, praise and worship leader, praise dancer, and intercessor.  In 2007, I was ordained as an evangelists in that very same ministry.</p>
				 
				<p>At some point during my service in the local church, I would say near the end, I was told by a figure of titled authority, that I was not a leader.  I was really taken back by what was spoken to me by this individual, especially since I had been serving for many years in what most people would define as a leadership role.  I felt crushed by this person, so naturally, spiritually, I went to GOD and HE spoke something to me that was one of the most defining moments of my life.  This is what GOD said, and I quote:
				"Man put's people in positions in the church organization, which is dead!  I position My people in the Body of Christ, which is a LIVING ORGANISM!</p>
				 
				<p>In 2014, GOD called me out of organized church religion.  Two years later, GOD transitioned me into sharing the gospel via the World Wide Web, and to reach the Nations through the ministry of Greater Works Prophetic Ministry.  GOD'S church, the Ecclesia, is truly a church without walls, where I am called to serve as a watchman on the walls.  And I wouldn't take nothing for my journey.  No turning back!</p>
			 
				<p>I've been commissioned by YAH GOD.  What GOD speaks privately, I speak publicly.</p>
