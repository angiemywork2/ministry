# ministry

Focus: 
	*Our client has multiple social media platforms for her small ministry. She has a Facebook, Twitter, a YouTube channel and a blog.  They are scattered about in various apps.  She and her users constantly switch from one platform to the next to retrieve informaion about the ministry.


Resolution:
	*As a solution, we have built her a webpage where all of her content is in one central location so that she can be more effective in her ministry. Now, she has an admin page where she can write her blog post, check her facebook, instagram and twitter.  Her followers now have one central location to interact with her and here her powerful message!


Creating a web app that centralizes and add new features that further emphasize her unique outlook on religion and allows her to reach her audience in a unique manner with her own blog.
